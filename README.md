# Designed

Designed is a TypeScript library to simplify building expressive, well-designed, domain driven services.

## Goals

1. **Replaceable**. Designed is easy to remove. Most DDD frameworks/libraries want to take front and center in your application. Designed wants to help you build easily understood and expressive services.
2. **Flexible**. Designed attempts to simplify standing up services using your own project structure and domain language. It will never tie you to a specific transport protocol or datastore.
3. **Product First**. Designed is focused on translating domain languages into code in the fastest way possible.

## Installation

Install with your favourite package manager.

```
npm i designed
```
```
yarn add designed
```

## Modules

Designed is comprised of opt-in modules. You can use any of these without dependency on other designed modules.
